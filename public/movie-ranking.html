<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images. The hand-drawn animation is stunning, and the world-building is so rich and immersive. Every frame feels like a piece of art. The story is also incredibly deep and meaningful, with themes of growth, courage, and the importance of kindness. Chihiro’s journey is something I always connect with, and it’s just magical to watch every time.</p>
<p>Besides the visuals, the soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi is unforgettable. The music perfectly complements the mood and enhances the emotional impact of the scenes. It’s a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll.</p>

<li><h3>Ex Machina</h3></li>

<p>Really cool sci-fi movie. It’s not just about the futuristic technology, but also about the ethical and philosophical questions it raises about artificial intelligence. The tension between the characters is palpable, and the minimalistic setting only adds to the feeling of isolation and uncertainty. It’s thought-provoking and makes you reflect on the role of AI in our future. The way the plot twists are slowly revealed keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>
<p>The performances in this film are top-notch. Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson, and Oscar Isaac all give incredible performances. The character of Ava, in particular, is both eerie and sympathetic, and her complexity is what makes the film so intriguing.</p>

<li><h3>Drive</h3></li>

<p>Super beautiful film. Really artistic. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; every shot is so carefully composed. It has a certain retro vibe, but with a modern twist. The soundtrack, with its synth-heavy 80s-inspired tunes, fits the tone perfectly and elevates the whole experience. It’s one of those movies where the visual storytelling is just as important as the plot itself.</p>
<p>The film also has a very unique rhythm. It’s not in a hurry to tell you everything, and there’s a quiet intensity to Ryan Gosling’s character. His performance is understated, but it makes an impact. The film’s use of silence and stillness to convey emotion is something I really appreciate, and it's what makes it stand out in the genre.</p>
